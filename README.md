# Korbin Sargent - Porfolio

## Description

This web application was built using React. It provides a space to view some of my favorite projects as well as links to my github, linkedin, email, and resume. Please leave me a message if interested in working together or questions on how I build. I'm currently searching for a front end developer position.
