          Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer based out of Denver, CO. I have experience in building both the
          front-end and back-end of web applications. My primary experience is
          with JavaScript, NodeJS and React, but I am highly interested in
          expanding my knowledge base to other technologies as well. In my previous career as an environmental scientist, I
          worked with a passionate team where we developed solutions to complex
          remediation problems. My skills as a problem solver and ability to learn quickly have allowed me
          to excel in a developer role. Let's work together to create somethings great!</p>
