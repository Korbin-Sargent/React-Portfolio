          Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer with experience building both the
          front-end and back-end of web applications. My primary experience is
          with JavaScript, NodeJS and React, but I am highly interested in
          Python as well. In my previous career as an environmental scientist, I
          worked with a passionate team where we developed solutions to complex
          remediation problems. Being a builder at heart has allowed me to progress my developer skills quickly. I'm excited to be a life long learner as a member of the web development community. <br />
